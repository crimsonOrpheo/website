During my academic exchange at Maastricht University in 2016, I dedicated my thesis research to online conversion, and applied statistical techniques on a site-centric dataset from a French e-retailer. This work, titled "How can e-retailers reduce the gap between online and offline conversion rates?" was chosen to represent Maastricht University at the Dutch Marketing Thesis Award in 2016.

>This paper introduces and investigates the gap between online and offline conversion rates. After reviewing a large body of literature on both physical retailing and e-retailing, the author designs a theoretical framework with nine factors that significantly influence conversion probabilities: customer characteristics, retailer characteristics, website characteristics, offering characteristics, session characteristics, competition, previous touch-points, post-purchase experience and exogenous factors. In order to validate this framework, qualitative and quantitative methods are applied. On one hand, the author conducted four focus groups and a few in-depth interviews to gather critical feedback from consumers and digital professionals. On the other hand, the author applied three statistical techniques (logistic, OLS and symbolic regressions) to a click-stream data set provided by a major click-and-mortar retailer in France. In addition to the theoretical framework and the statistical results, the author also outlines four major opportunities for e-retailers, and many ideas for further research. This effort should mainly be considered as a ground work for follow-up studies that the author wishes to pursue.
